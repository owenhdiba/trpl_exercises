# Company Directory CLI

A simple command-line interface for adding employees to departments
and listing employees in a department using text commands.

This is one of the exercises left to the reader at the end of Chapter 8 in *The
Rust Programming Language*.

Supported input text commands:
- `Add <Name> to <Department>`
- `Show <Department>`

Example:
```text
> Add Alice to Sales
> Show Sales
Employees: ["Alice"]
```
