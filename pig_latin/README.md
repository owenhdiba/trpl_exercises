A CLI program that takes user input of a sentence and translates it to Pig Latin.

This is one of the exercises left to the reader at the end of Chapter 8 in *The
Rust Programming Language*.
# Overview
The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter an ASCII string until
valid input is provided. 

The program terminates after printing the translation for the first valid input.

## Example usage
```text
Please input your sentence to translate into Pig Latin.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 
Translation: Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay umpsjay overhay hetay azylay ogday
```
